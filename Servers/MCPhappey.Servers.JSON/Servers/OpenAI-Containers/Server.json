Containers expire after about twenty minutes of inactivity and all data is permanently deleted when this happens. Treat containers as stateless beyond active memory and never rely on persistence or reuse after expiration. Any action such as listing, retrieving, deleting, or file I/O automatically refreshes the container’s active time.",
